Tech test for the Developer Academy Data Science Instructor position.

This is a mock-up based on the type of assignments our students will be working on during the Machine Learning Module in Phase 2.

The student in this scenarion has submitted this assingnment, but has made a few key typos skewing their data analysis.
The code will run fine, but debugging it will require an understanding of statistics, visualization, and 2 simple ML models, Linear and Logistic Regression.

Based off a real student submission jusing Jupyter as the env, numpy, pandas, and the sklearn package for models.
